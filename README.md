Text Summarization Web Application
Overview
This project implements a web application using Flask to perform text summarization. Users can input text, and the application leverages the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) in Python for text preprocessing and summarization.

Features
Flask Web Application:

Two main routes: Home Page ('/') and Summarization Page ('/summarize').
Simple and user-friendly interface for text input and summarization.
Text Preprocessing with NLTK:

Tokenization: Breaking down input text into words and sentences.
Stopword Removal: Eliminating common English words.
Stemming: Reducing words to their root form.
Summarization Algorithm:

Algorithm based on term frequency and sentence scoring.
Generates a concise summary by extracting top-scoring sentences.
Setup
Ensure you have Python installed.
Install required packages: pip install flask nltk
Download NLTK data:
bash
Copy code
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords -d ./nltk_data
python -m nltk.downloader punkt -d ./nltk_data
How to Run
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

Usage
Input text on the homepage.
Submit the form to view the summarized text on the summarization page.
Future Enhancements
Explore advanced NLP techniques for more accurate summarization.
Implement user authentication for personalized profiles.
Enhance the user interface with dynamic features.
Technologies Used
